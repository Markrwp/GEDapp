# GEDapp - 
A GUI app in Python for genealogists to read, save and print the contents of .ged/.csv files.
Find where you are missing data!
GEDapp does NOT create family tree displays or reports.
The on-screen data is only as good as the data you have included/saved in a .ged file.
You DO NOT need to be online to use this app.
GEDapp does not send your data anywhere, other than where you copy & paste it on your machine.
The buttons are self-explanatory - try them!
